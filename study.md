### Questions
**How does someone empower themself in a digital world?**

In a digital world, you can empower yourself by learning new things, meeting new people, and giving others some of your knowledge on the internet. You can then apply these skills in the real world. 

**How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.**

Someone who is empowered can help someone who is not empowered by lending them some advice, help, or knowledge. Learning from each other is vital to lifting each other up and empowering each other. At Del Norte HS, I could help a confused classmate with their classwork or homework to make them feel more empowered. 

**Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?**

Red tape is blocking digital empowerment. At Del Norte, I would say that there are very few barriers because we have a lot of access to the internet and technology. For instance, in our computer science classroom, we have extra computers that aren't even in use. I would say that there are barriers elsewhere becasue some areas lack sufficient technology supplies to become digitally empowered.
