Three beneficial effects of computing are being able to contact to people all over the world, further your education online, and making money online. Three corresponding harmful effectss are meeting somebody dangerous online, recieving fake information, and getting hacked or scammed.

**Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?**

Yes, personally, I struggle with procrastination. Pushing off my homework to keep my dopamine levels higher is something that I do almost every day. If I didn't have this issue, I would be able to complete my schoolwork and homework faster,

### Questions
**How does someone empower themself in a digital world?**

In a digital world, you can empower yourself by learning new things, meeting new people, and giving others some of your knowledge on the internet. You can then apply these skills in the real world. 

**How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.**

Someone who is empowered can help someone who is not empowered by lending them some advice, help, or knowledge. Learning from each other is vital to lifting each other up and empowering each other. At Del Norte HS, I could help a confused classmate with their classwork or homework to make them feel more empowered. 

**Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?**

Red tape is blocking digital empowerment. At Del Norte, I would say that there are very few barriers because we have a lot of access to the internet and technology. For instance, in our computer science classroom, we have extra computers that aren't even in use. I would say that there are barriers elsewhere becasue some areas lack sufficient technology supplies to become digitally empowered.

### Questions
**Watch the video... [HP computers are racist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4DT3tQqgRM)**

**Come up with some thoughts on the video and be ready to discuss them as I call on you. Here are some ideas...**

**Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional?**

No, I believe the owner of the computer doesn't think this was intentional, but he wants to bring light to the exclusion he's facing. 

**If yes or no, justify you conclusion.**

I think no because I believe the compuuter owner thinks that HP didn't conduct enough testing on different types of people rather than HP being racist. 
 
**How do you think this happened?**

I think this happened because HP didn't test their camera software with a diverse group of people. This is what led to the software only working on lighter skin tones. 

**Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude?**

Yes, this is very harmful. I believe it wasn't intended to be harmful or to exclude, but it ended up excluding a large group of people just becausue of their skin color.

**Should it be corrected?**

Yes, this error should be corrected so that HP computers are inclusuive of all users. 

**What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome?**

To produce a better outcome, I believe HP should test their camera software on all races and skin colors. This will ensure the software works for all different types of people, regardless of skin color.

**What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?**

Yes, my final product could be better with crowdsourcing because I could get input from other students. I could also get ideas that I may have never been able to think of.

(notes above)

**Make a license for your personal and Team project. Document license you picked and why.**

Our team project chose Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal because we liked that it dedicates it to the world-wide public domain. For my personal project, I chose the Open Source MIT License because I liked that it allows using code freely and making/distributing closed source versions.

### Notes
- Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
- Websites maintain a history of what you search
- - Used to suggest other websites you may like or for targeted marketing
- - Location may be collected
- Risk to Privacy
- - Information on the internet is hard to delete

### Questions
**Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles.**

PII is Personally Identifiable Information. I have seen PII on projects its CompSci Principles in passwords, names, emails, and phone numbers in the CRUD database. 

**What are your feelings about PII and your exposure?**

I feel that PII is important for identification and personal use, but I feel like it can sometimes be dangerous to have your PII available to other users on the internet. For example, a credit card would be bad PII for the public to see.

**Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication.**

Good passwords have uppercase, lowercase, symbol, and number characters. Bad passwords have only one form of characters or have something that identifies you in them; for example, a pet or your mom's name. Another step that is used to assist in authentication is multi factor authentication (using another device to verify your identity) or biometrics.

**Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption.**

Symmetric encrytion happens when there's only one key, which is secret, and this key is used to decrypt and encrypt electronic data/information. Asymmetric encryption/cryptography happens when there's a pair of related keys, including one private and one public. These are used to decrypt and encrypt information to protect it from unauthorized use/access. 

**Provide and example of encryption we used in deployment.**

In deployment, an example of encryption we used in deployment is SSL, which uses both symmetric and asymmetric encryption. 

**Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques.**

A phishing scheme I've learned about the hard way happened when I tried to watch a movie on a poor website. When I clicked on the movie, an "ad" popped up and asked me to download the movie, so I clicked it. Then, malware was downloaded onto my computer. Another phishing technique could be fake websites that steal your credit card information/other PII after you enter it.
