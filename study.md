### Questions
**Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing**

Three beneficial effects of computing are being able to contact to people all over the world, further your education online, and making money online. Three corresponding harmful effectss are meeting somebody dangerous online, recieving fake information, and getting hacked or scammed.

**Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?**

Yes, personally, I struggle with procrastination. Pushing off my homework to keep my dopamine levels higher is something that I do almost every day. If I didn't have this issue, I would be able to complete my schoolwork and homework faster,

### Questions
**How does someone empower themself in a digital world?**

In a digital world, you can empower yourself by learning new things, meeting new people, and giving others some of your knowledge on the internet. You can then apply these skills in the real world. 

**How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.**

Someone who is empowered can help someone who is not empowered by lending them some advice, help, or knowledge. Learning from each other is vital to lifting each other up and empowering each other. At Del Norte HS, I could help a confused classmate with their classwork or homework to make them feel more empowered. 

**Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?**

Red tape is blocking digital empowerment. At Del Norte, I would say that there are very few barriers because we have a lot of access to the internet and technology. For instance, in our computer science classroom, we have extra computers that aren't even in use. I would say that there are barriers elsewhere becasue some areas lack sufficient technology supplies to become digitally empowered.

### Questions
**Watch the video... [HP computers are racist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4DT3tQqgRM)**

**Come up with some thoughts on the video and be ready to discuss them as I call on you. Here are some ideas...**

**Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional?**

No, I believe the owner of the computer doesn't think this was intentional, but he wants to bring light to the exclusion he's facing. 

**If yes or no, justify you conclusion.**

I think no because I believe the compuuter owner thinks that HP didn't conduct enough testing on different types of people rather than HP being racist. 
 
**How do you think this happened?**

I think this happened because HP didn't test their camera software with a diverse group of people. This is what led to the software only working on lighter skin tones. 

**Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude?**

Yes, this is very harmful. I believe it wasn't intended to be harmful or to exclude, but it ended up excluding a large group of people just becausue of their skin color.

**Should it be corrected?**

Yes, this error should be corrected so that HP computers are inclusuive of all users. 

**What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome?**

To produce a better outcome, I believe HP should test their camera software on all races and skin colors. This will ensure the software works for all different types of people, regardless of skin color.

### Questions
**CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?**

A crowdsource idea could be determining the most popular school lunch food. I could initiate this by conducting a web survey in our classroom and then input the responses into a database. 

**What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?**

Yes, my final product could be better with crowdsourcing because I could get input from other students. I could also get ideas that I may have never been able to think of.
